Ideas for format
6/15/2019------

5000Hz sample rate?
8 bit unsigned PCM

6/19/2019------

8000hz
8 bit unsigned
songlength written on the card?

6/20/2019------

The time is now to experiment with bigger sample rates!
16khz might lead to 1. better quality audio, and 2. less noise (its like having a backup doubled up from 8khz)

for the future: redundant data? maybe two half-pages which are averaged together to reduce noise

NOISE REDUCTION is really important if this format is to be used for anything practical.
But it is an inherent part of the printing process as well, and must be worked around.

Quantization of gray shades?
auto calibrate with marks?
